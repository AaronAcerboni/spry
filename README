# Usage

`node spry.js`  

This will output an index.html and 404.html page providing your 
json syntax is correct.

# Spry

Spry is a static site generator perfect for creating simple and clean
html pages quickly.

Spry generates 2 simple html files; index and 404. This makes it perfect 
for a github page but can be used for anything else.

The two pages are configured in the `site.json` file.

For an example of a site built using spry see [halfmelt.com](halfmelt.com)
